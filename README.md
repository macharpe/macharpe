## Hi there 👋 I’m Matt,

Senior Sales Engineer with 14+ years of globe-trotting experience in networking, cloud, and data-because why limit yourself to just one country’s headaches? I’ve survived (and sometimes thrived) in France, Germany, the USA, Denmark, and the UK. Fluent in French, English, and German, so I can misunderstand technical jargon in three languages.

## ⛹️‍♂️ Skills

- **Technical Pre-Sales & Solution Engineering:** networking, cloud, data, cybersecurity-basically, if it has an acronym, I’ve sold it
- **Cloud & Security Certifications:** SASE, AWS, Aviatrix, Splunk, Snowflake, Cribl, Fortinet (collecting badges like a digital boy scout)
- **Multilingual Communication:** French, English, German (ask me to explain “latency” in any of them)
- **Leadership & Project Management:** Herding cats, aligning global accounts, and pretending to enjoy status meetings

## 🧪 Projects & Experience

- **Cloudflare Zero-Trust Demo Environment:**  
  Currently building a fully terraformed Cloudflare zero-trust demo environment. Coming soon-because Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither are demo labs.

## 😄 Fun Fact

If you ever find yourself at the Woking Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club, check out the honor board above the bar. Yup, that’s my name under 2012-the year I peaked athletically and won the Men’s Singles title.  
Also, I used to DJ and have published 50+ mixes. (Yes, my mother is proud. No, you can’t request “Sandstorm.”)

Effort, caffeine, and the occasional lucky bounce.
