# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Matthieu Charpentier

## About me

Welcome to my digital lair!  
I'm a seasoned e-commerce wizard with 10+ years of experience turning caffeine into data-driven decisions, and chaos into streamlined processes. I speak fluent SQL, Python, and sarcasm. When I'm not optimizing digital strategies or leading teams, you might find me plotting to automate my coffee machine.

## Skills

- **E-Commerce Sorcery:** From storefronts to supply chains, I've seen it all (and probably fixed it twice).
- **Data Whispering:** SQL, Python, Tableau â€“ if itâ€™s got data, Iâ€™ll make it talk.
- **Leadership & Strategy:** I build teams, craft visions, and occasionally win at office trivia.
- **Project Management:** Certified in turning "ASAP" into "Already Done."
- **Process Optimization:** If thereâ€™s a bottleneck, Iâ€™ll find it (and automate it).

## Projects

- **ðŸ›’ E-Com Dashboard:** Real-time analytics for online stores.  
  _Because who doesnâ€™t want to know whatâ€™s selling at 3AM?_

- **ðŸ“Š Data Pipeline Automator:** ETL with style (and error handling that actually works).

- **ðŸ¤– Slackbot Sidekick:** Automated reminders, reports, and the occasional meme for team morale.

_P.S.: Check my pinned repos for more! Or just say hi â€“ I promise not to automate you (yet)._
